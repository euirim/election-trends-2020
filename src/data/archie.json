Mention volume should not be interpreted as being synonymous with candidate popularity. High volumes may indicate significant controversies, inauthentic interference (e.g. from bot networks), or simply greater candidate name recognition. \n\nThe literature on whether candidate popularity on Twitter can be used as a predictor for election performance is still underdeveloped.
